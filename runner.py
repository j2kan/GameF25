"""
The Challenge
There are two players.
Each player writes a number, hidden from the other player. It can be any integer 1 or greater.
The players reveal their numbers.
Whoever chose the lower number gets 1 point, unless the lower number is lower by only 1,
then the player with the higher number gets 2 points.
If they both chose the same number, neither player gets a point.
This repeats, and the game ends when one player has 5 points.
The challenge is to write a script to play this game.
Knowing the rules and all your opponentâ€™s previous numbers, can you program a strategy?
