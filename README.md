#Game of first to 5.
Place to improve logic and programming skills

The Challenge

There are two players.

Each player writes a number, hidden from the other player. It can be any integer 1 or greater.

The players reveal their numbers.

Whoever chose the lower number gets 1 point, unless the lower number is lower by only 1, then the player with the higher number gets 2 points.

If they both chose the same number, neither player gets a point.

This repeats, and the game ends when one player has 5 points.

The challenge is to write a script to play this game. 

Knowing the rules and all your opponentâ€™s previous numbers, can you program a strategy?
